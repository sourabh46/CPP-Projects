# CPP-Projects
Projects that are completed using C++ programming language

CommandLineArgument - Calculate area and/or perimeter of a rectangle by executing the application along with necessary command line arguments. [Time = 30 minutes]

Inheritance - Write a simple program that helps to understand the concept of inheritance in C++ where Supervisor is a sub-class of Worker and Worker is a sub-class of Employee. [Time = 20 minutes]

List - Design a List class that has a certain content (array of characters) and length (size of the array of characters). List can be constructed by a given array of characters and size; or even it can be initialized as empty. At any point of time, the list can output its current size, return any indexed element, tell if a character is its member or not; or even it can return common-elements found with another List; and of course print its member elements as well. [Time = 45 minutes]

NonDuplicateNumberInVector - Find the non-duplicate numbers in a vector. For example, if input vector is { 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 7, 8, 6, 3, 9 }, then output vector will be {5, 6, 8, 9}. [Time = 15 minutes]

Teddy - Design a class for a Teddy Bear. Teddy has name, age, color and energy. These information are not directly accessible, rather it is intended to write some functions to set, get or update those values. [Time = 20 minutes]

WaterJug - Design a class for a Water Jug that has a certain capacity and holds an amount of water. It should be possible to do some activities with the jug (e.g. fill the jug with some amount, drink some water or even break the jug). At any time, it is possible to describe the jug with current status. [Time = 30 minutes]
